    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Grace Hopper Academy and enjoying my time.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Grace Hopper on my blog. 
    Look at my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

      Talk soon,<br>
